## PORTFOLIO V1

![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

## Description
This is my first edition of my Junior Web Devloper Portfolio which only use HTML and CSS. The portfolio was created in a manner that isolates certain aspects of my career, personal life, and my contact links. This is the first edition of my portfolio and i will or already have at this point created a seperate version of this portfolio using REACT.

- My primary motivation for this portfolio was showcasing the simplest art form i could find (8-bit) as a means of adding flare to each page. The themes are different on each and every page.

- A Portfolio is a must have for any Engineering field. Showcasing ones learning ability and their dedication to their work applies over any field, not just the Software development field. 

- I have learned more about CSS in the completion of this project than any other personal project.
